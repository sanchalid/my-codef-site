Moving schools again and again was exciting at first. I saw the opportunity to get to know different people and moving to new beautiful places as a blessing...
But this left me with an identity crisis at a certain stage of my life and I could never understand where I fit in. On top of all of this, acne and anxiety came through too.

Eventually meditation, swimming more regularly and healthy eating made all of this almost vanish. But the most important ingredient is learning to accept that **it's okay for things not go your way for a while**...I just learned to let go and see where life wants to take me.
