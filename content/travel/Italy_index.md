# When in Rome...

For years, Italy has remained as the world's favourite tourist destination. The beauty, food, history and culture almost compels you to just stop and take it all in.
But itâ€™s not just the unique architectural styles, aromatic food and its many famouse monuments. The people and their love for family is what makes Italy so special.
I had the pleasure of visiting Rome and Venice in the same trip and must say it's a **once in your life** type of place. Hope you enjoy my photography...
