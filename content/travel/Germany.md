# Couple of things I loved:
* __*The Food*__

I was really suprised to see the range of cuisines available on the High Streets in West Berlin. From Turkish to Chinese, you could find all sorts of mouth-watering snacks and meals at **extremely affordable prices**. Be sure to grab a currywurst while you're there!

* __*The People*__

It's embarrassing to say how many times we got lost, especially when we trying to find Checkpoint Charlie. However, it was so easy to just turn to someone for help and get the right directions! We always felt at ease and really safe despite being out till quite late.

* __*History*__

If you loved History as a student (like me), Germany is definitely a great place to visit. Berlin is a unique city which has managed to retain a balance of the past and present. The Wall still stands as a tourist attraction and monument in some parts of the city. Ironically, I was studying Germany as part of my History GCSE at the time and it was mesmerising to see it in real.
