# Fall in love with Paris
Paris is a great city, with a blend of being a small town. Everyone has a relaxed and friendly vibe. I loved to see how most people take a break to have breakfast calmly (how to do otherwise, with the wonders of pastry that are in France!), to have lunch on the Seine or to observe a street artist. Paris has remained authentic and has preserved its quintessentially French architecture. I found that the Eiffel Tower was much prettier at night! If you ever have the pleasuer of visiting, do be sure that you don't get in the way of a proposal (yes I got in the way twice lol)!

# Versailles
A description of Versailles, the most famous (and golden) palace in the world! I was so intrigued and I wanted to visit it so much. It represents the personality of Louis XIV, a megalomaniac character, and represents it perfectly.  Inside the palace is the famous **Hall of Mirrors**, which I loved. It is immense and very lavish, a beautiful ceremonial hall. You feel overwhelmed by the glitzyness inside.
