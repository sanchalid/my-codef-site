Sanchali literally translates into movement or moving. Quite fitting I suppose, since I've been to about 20 schools and lived in three countries. This had initially left me with multiple accents and a severe identity crisis...
 
 Fast foward a couple of years, I now live in the U.K and currently an Accounting and Business student at Henley Business School. 2 days ago I became a part-qualified ACA (Chartered Accountant) and now ready to progress to third year.

In my spare time, I swim, draw and love going on road trips or late night drives. I've been swimming for the past 12 years and teach children of all ages at my local leisure centre.

 Here is a pic of lil Sanchali:
